    <strong>
Just one more tear to cry<br/>
One teardrop from my eye<br/>
You better save it for<br/>
The middle of the night<br/>
When things aren't black and white<br/>
Enter, Troubadour<br/>
Remember twenty-four?<br/>

And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it<br/>
Another version of me, I was in it<br/>
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning<br/>

This song has started now<br/>
And you're just finding out<br/>
Now, isn't that a laugh?<br/>
A major sacrifice<br/>
But clueless at the time<br/>
Enter, Caroline<br/>
Just trust me, you'll be fine<br/>

And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it<br/>
Another version of me, I was in it<br/>
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning<br/>
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)<br/>

You take the man out of the city<br/>
Not the city out the man<br/>
You take the man out of the city<br/>
Not the city out the man<br/>
You take the man out of the city<br/>
Not the city out the man<br/>
You take the man out of the<br/>

And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it<br/>
Another version of me, I was in it<br/>
Oh, I wave goodbye to the end of beginning<br/>
(Goodbye, goodbye)<br/>
